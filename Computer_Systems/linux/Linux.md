### Description
---
Linux is an **open-source operating system (OS)** based on the Unix architecture. It manages hardware resources (CPU, memory, etc.) and provides an environment for applications to run. Unlike traditional proprietary OSes like Windows or macOS, Linuxâ€™s **source code is freely available**, allowing developers to modify, distribute, and create different versions (called **distributions**, like Ubuntu, Fedora, or Debian).

### Key Features
---
- **Open-source:** Anyone can view, modify, and distribute the code.
- **Security:** Linux is considered very secure due to its robust permission model and open-source nature.
- **Stability:** It's known for running without interruptions, which is why it's widely used on servers.
- **Customization:** You can tweak the system down to its core, from the kernel to the desktop environment.
- Linux is coded entirely in [[c]].
- Utilizes Command line [[Linux-Commands|commands]]
