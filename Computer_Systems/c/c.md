C is a **general-purpose programming language** that was originally created in the early 1970s by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs. It is known for being powerful and efficient, often referred to as a "low-level" language because it gives programmers significant control over system resources like memory and CPU usage.

Key features of C:

- **Portability:** Code written in C can often be easily ported to different platforms.
- **Efficiency:** C is very close to machine code, which makes it fast and efficient.
- **[[System-level programming]]:** It is widely used to write operating systems, embedded systems, and hardware drivers because of its direct access to hardware and memory.
- **Procedural language:** It follows a structured approach to breaking down tasks into functions and procedures.
