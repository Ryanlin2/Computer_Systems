Secure Hash Algorithm 1 is a cryptographic hash function that takes an input and produces a 160 bit or 20 byte hash value, often represented as a 40-digit hexadecimal number. it's one of the earlier hash functions developed by the National Security Agency (NSA) and published by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in 1993.

SHA-1 processes data in blocks of 512 bits. It divides the input into 512 bit chunks, processes each chunk through a series of operations, and then combines them to produce the final 160 bit hash value. This process involves bitwise operations, logical functions and modulo additions.
